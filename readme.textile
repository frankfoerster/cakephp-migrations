h1. Migrations Plugin for CakePHP 2.3+ !https://travis-ci.org/frankfoerster/cakephp-migrations.png?branch=master!:https://travis-ci.org/frankfoerster/cakephp-migrations

This migrations plugin is based on the work of "CakeDC/migrations":https://github.com/CakeDC/migrations.

bc. This plugin is currently under development and not ready for production until the 1.0.0 release.

The main goals for the rewrite are:

* move the migration commands to their own functions "up" and "down"
* make all migration actions as atomic as possible to ease testing
* use PHP + CakePHP methods, models in your migrations
* no need for "before" or "after" callbacks since migrations are method calls
* remove migration mappings
instead use file names with numeric and datetime prefixes + unique migration class names
* use semantic version numbering major.minor.patch
* releases will be tagged with their corresponding version number
* provide at least 90% code coverage
